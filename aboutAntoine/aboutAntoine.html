        <article class="music">
            <p>I am a huge fan of music. I always have spotify on ! It is really difficult to say which type of music is my favorite as I basically listen to 1000 different ones : </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Classical Music</li>
                <li>Chill house</li>
                <li>Traditionnal music from all over Europe</li>
                <li>Rap (french / US)</li>
                <li>etc...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I guess it is kind of important to precise that I played cello for over 15 years. Unfortuantely I had to stop when I moved to the US. But I will definitely start again.</p>

        <article class="videoGames">
            <p>A (HUGE) part of my life is dedicated to video games. Some people might thing this is a loss of time but I think this is an incredible source of imagination and creativity. I also met a lot of awesome people thanks to video games and play daily with my best friends. For us, it is almost as good as going to have a beer. </p>
