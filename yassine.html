            I love my bicycle. It’s like who I want to be—beautiful and functional. When I ride it, it makes me feel like we’re a new thing that is powerful and brave and a part of the world on our very own terms.

            Breathing deeply, through the nose, try finding stillness and graditude, and living in the here&now, finding balance between activity and resting.. On the mat it's focussing, and finding concentration, when I'm in "the flow" my mind calms.

        <h4>photography</h4>
        <p>
            I enjoy photography because it has caused me to fall in love with light and see the world around me with fresh eyes every single day. And sometimes, when the mood is right, I just sit back and enjoy the moment without taking a photo.

          Choosing the right music, the right notes, beautiful transaction and lovely people dancing on your improvised live playlist, it's a pure joy.
